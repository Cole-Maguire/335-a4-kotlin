# Readme

Mirror of my solution for bonus marks to A1/A4 for CompSci 335 at UoA. This is the version written in Kotlin JS/CSS/HTML - for the JS/CSS/HTML version see [here.](https://github.com/Cole-Maguire/335-a4-js)

This was my first foray into Kotlin, as well as into Android app development in general, so I'm sure there's a lot of less-than-best practice in here (even down to the fact that there's probably a whole heap of unnecessary guff in the repo) but I like the language a lot (besides some of the pain in getting various Android layout files etc. hooked up correctly) and I hope to do more with it in future. 

Unlike the JS version of this assignment, this app was developed against the public server provided for this assignment, so all API calls still ought to work fine for as long as the server is kept up (though I can't guarantee how long this will be.)

All marks have now been released so I feel safe making this public.
